UNIT DEMAND GENERATOR FOR COMPETITION, CRISIS, AND CONFLICT CONTIUUM 
By: 2ndLt Jessi Lanum

PROBLEM: Realistic demand generation is neccessary for increasing realism for logistics-based wargames. 
PURPOSE: Provide realistic demand generation for each class of supply depending on unit size and state.
OBJECTIVE: Provide quantitative demand data output for logistics-based wargames.

LAST UPDATED: xx JUL 23

#NOTE
This one will be all classes of supply outputted for each state of existance.

INTERNAL PROBLEM: I dislike having so many variables defined, but I can't think of a slicker option...
SOLUTION: Attempting for the first time some tuple unpacking. 

FUTURE USEAGE THOUGHTS: If adding to a larger program, probably refactor to seperate program into multiple
files. This way all variables can be in their own variables.py file. Potentially refactor this in the end to
do this. Add one option for all classes per state, and then one class with all states.
