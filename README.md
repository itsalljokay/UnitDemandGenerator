# UnitDemandGenerator

UnitDemandGenerator is a demand generation tool for daily demand requests for platoon, company, MLR, and MEF sized-elements in competition, crisis, or conflict states.

## Getting Started
There are two options for running this project, in the browser or locally.

### To Run In The Browser
Follow this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/itsalljokay/UnitDemandGenerator/blob/main/UnitDemandGeneratorOnline.ipynb#scrollTo=BjZA_gC9qSCm) to the online notebook. 
Alternatively, click on UnitDemandGeneratorOnline.ipynb in this repository and then the "Open in Collab" button that appears at the top.

To run the code in Google Collab, navigate to the RunTime menu, and then run all. If prompted that this is not a native Google Collab file, select run anyway.

To view the outputs, select files from the side menu, then the outputs folder. In the outputs folder, all the spreadsheets will be organized by class, state, and unit. There will also be an all_data file that will contain all the data without the organizational categories listed.

### To Run Locally
This project requires Python with the following libraries.
* Numpy
* Pandas

Setup your environment to be able to run Python files, as well has have the necessary permissions to allow the import functions in main.py to download the above dependencies. Run as you would a normal Python file, and the outputs will populate in the appropriate folders.

## Usage

Detailed commenting is provided within the main.py program file.
